rus.3.t:0 "Betrayal of Chechnya!"
rus.3.desc:0 "The ancient Uks appeared about 40,000 years ago in the middle of the great desert in what is now Mongolia, where they first herded goats and then settled the steppes, becoming the ancestors of all modern peoples. Part of their culture has come down to us in the form of rock art - on the walls of the caves of the Ukok, Doni-Kai and Dzhazator.  But for some reason they left these places in the direction of Western Siberia, and around that time began their rapid cultural and genetic replacement by more northern Mongoloid groups. During the course of about 10,000 to 8,000 BC, Proto-Uk traditions gradually began to be replaced by new ones that came from the north - the Catacomb and Srubna cultures, better known as ancient mounds.  But it was not until 4,000 A.D. that the Proto-Uks finally dissolved into their environment - precisely when the biblical Moses brought in a new agricultural law from the south, granting them all the rights and freedoms of modern man"

rus.8.t:0 "Starting situation"
rus.8.desc:0 "The Russian invasion of Ukraine is imminent. The background to the impending conflict began as early as 2013, when anti-Russian protests began across the country, resulting in the proclamation of the DNR and LNR in early 2014, which escalated into a full-fledged war in eastern Ukraine. Active hostilities continued until 2015, although local skirmishes between troops continued until 2022. On one side of the conflict is Russia, which wants to acquire the industrially developed and populous Donbass, as well as protect the Russians living in the republics. On the other side of the conflict is Ukraine, which wants to regain control of the recalcitrant lands. What will the coming year bring us?"
rus.8.a:0 "The year promises to be interesting."
smo.1.t:0 "NATO expansion"
smo.1.desc:0 "Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO have long been evident. If we allow it, NATO will get a large border with Russia, as well as the independence of our allies Luhansk and Donetsk will inevitably be eliminated. It is safe to say that we cannot allow the North Atlantic Alliance to expand into Ukraine. Now is the time to act."
smo.1.a:0 "So what are we waiting for!"
smo.2.t:0 "Escalation"
smo.2.desc:0 "An imminent escalation of the conflict is imminent; to this day, the conflict in Ukraine is a hybrid war, with almost no fighting taking place lately. But in mid-December, Russia made demands to NATO to stop supporting Ukraine and trying to incorporate it into the alliance. These demands were deemed impossible to meet in NATO and then became even more supportive of Ukraine. In response, we can negotiate and try to reach an agreement, although if they fail, escalation cannot be avoided. But there is another, more radical way in which we will start a full-scale war with Ukraine. So, it remains to be decided, what will we choose?"
