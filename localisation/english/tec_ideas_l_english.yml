 weak_ideology_desc:0 "Phrases such as "I feel like a citizen" (parallel to "I feel like a citizen") are often used. As a result, they are often identified with nationalism and ownership. Because feelings of belonging and patriotism vary from person to person, some believe that the word "patriot" comes from the Latin "patria. In other words, the word "patriotism" means love for someone or something, a sense of belonging. The difference may confuse the historical meaning of the term. Perhaps in the context of patriotism, citizenship can be a love associated with countries other than one's own. See also duty, patriotism, and patriotism. Some specialists consider patriotism to be patriotism of all cultures (Garfield). Citizenship and what patriotism was in ancient cultures is just an idea that has nothing to do with actual feelings. The sayings of ancient philosophers, including Cicero, were ideological expressions. And patriotism is no different from the patriotism of ordinary people. Well, this problem does not exist at all, because there cannot be one person, one country, one culture. Only modern history continues the historical tradition of the fall of the empire and refers to the nation today. Nationalism should not be confused with patriotism, because patriotism is patriotism, and "father" is often interpreted as "birthplace. Also, love and duty to his country should not be the same, for example, a responsible and honest citizen committed a crime against another person. That patriotism, like love, is responsibility. This manifests itself in daily activity, meaningful work, success, patriotism and greater responsibility. Such activity completely deprives a person of what is called patriotism, the feeling of being a son of the nation. On the other hand, the legitimacy and precision of this feeling determines what others, especially consumer society, dismiss as "false" nationalism. As a market, "real" nationalists can rely on television and the media to support nationalist politicians. The socio-political coalition is nothing more than a media-created sense of patriotism, reflecting the principle of patriotism. Patriotism is a form of prostitution. At the same time, it is "engaged" in public life, including a large number of politicians, businessmen, and other leaders who create patriotic activities that satisfy the need for love and respect. In this way it is possible to artificially increase their social status and influence. All this is in accordance with the general law of the market economy, which, on the one hand, regulates the health of commercial relations and, on the other hand, regulates people's private lives. Bilateral attacks during election campaigns are part of the "political comfort" in many countries. It won't happen because it is the will of politicians or public opinion. That's how the great conscience works. So you can. It's actually very simple. Every disagreement between us is like a show or a show. So there are a lot of new faces on the scene who play an acceptable political role and pretend to be sympathetic to us. This is happening at all levels, from large governments to medium-sized companies. To prevent the misuse of this technology and the use of weapons of mass destruction, it is necessary to have a legal framework to prevent such actions. The original text is taken from the information on this page. When I was young, I traveled all over the world for fun. I always get the feeling that when I'm in a big city, I'm suddenly transported to another world. I've been to Rome, Florence, the Ligurian coast, I feel like I've just stepped out of the water and mingled with the crowds of central Italy. But I don't remember where I am because I lived for a long time in a closed country like Turkey and Greece. Despite the small size, I have short-term relationships between countries for diplomatic or business purposes. On a trip like this, I become myself - I feel my place, who I am and what I say. I really enjoyed it, but now, through a strange accident, I find myself back in the city."
